# 3CAPES
## Inspiration
Every two seconds someone needs blood in India and each year our nation requires about 4 Crore units, out of which only a meagre 40 Lakh units of blood are available. Not everyone is able to get the blood in right time, so they suffer from very heartbreaking losses. 
## What it does
It helps people to find beds in hospitals, setup blood donation camp in their locality and also provides covid related info.
##  How we built it 
React js , Axios , Firebase

##  Challenges we ran into
Deployment issues, dependency errors 
##  ✨Accomplishments that we're proud of ✨
The final deployment of our project and that can be helpful in community in the time of emergency.
## What we learned
leaned about form handling in react.js
## What's next for 3CAPES 
We are looking forward to add more features in our project and make the website more interactive with users.3
